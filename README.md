## <br>Introduction
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to combine and practice implementing what has been learned thus far by leveraging data to explore a problem and presenting our findings. 

### <br>Objective
The objective is to define a specific problem and thoroughly investigate it using various data analysis techniques, such as data retrieval, exploratory data analysis, and statistical modelling in Python. This analysis will be presented through a visualization dashboard, aiming to showcase key insights and propose potential solutions. Additionally, a user-friendly procedure will be developed, enabling non-technical users to easily interact with and utilize the dashboard.

## <br>Process
### Project Planning
- The selected dataset is based on the '[100,000 UK Used Car Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityadesai13/used-car-dataset-ford-and-mercedes/)'.
- We will be focusing on the cleaned csv files of the different brands (this excludes brand specific ones like cclass.csv and focus.csv).

### <br>Project Setup
- Create a collaborative project on GitHub.

### <br>Project Workflow
#### Step 1
- The dataset already contains clean data we can begin with outlier identification.
#### Step 2
...
#### Step 3

### <br>Project Development

## <br>Results
The dataset Contains characteristics related to the vehicle:
- model: The specific designation given to a particular type or version of a vehicle made by a manufacturer.
- year: The year in which the vehicile was manufactured or registered. 
- price: The monetary value associated with buying or selling the vehicle.
- transmission: Determines how power is transmitted from the engine to the wheels using gears.
- mileage: The total distance (in miles) the vehicle has travelled (indicates how much it has been used).
- fuelType: The type of fuel the vehicle uses to generate power and operate.
- tax: The tax amount associated with owning or using the vehicle (can depend on emissions, vehicle type, or government regulations).
- mpg: The miles per gallon; a measure of a vehicle's fuel efficiency, representing the number of miles it can travel using one gallon of fuel.
- engineSize: The size or capacity of the vehicle's engine (in litres), it provides an indication of the engine's power and performance capabilities.
